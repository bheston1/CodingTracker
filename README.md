# CodingTracker

More SQLite practice in the form of a time tracker for coding sessions. 

Main purpose was to play around with DateTime a bit

# Given Requirements:
 - [x] User should be able to log session times and view them with duration of session
 - [x] Database path and connection string should be stored in a config file
 - [x] User should input start and end times manually
 - [x] Calculate session duration in separate function

# Details

* Simple menu for handling database operations
